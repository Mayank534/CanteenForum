# CENTRALIZING CANTEEN in IITK CAMPUS 

## AIM- 
we aim to develop a website where all the canteen owners can login through their ids and then add the amount of a particular student by their roll number or their name. At the end of each month each student would get mail of their monthly bill, they will then pay their money to the app, and the app distributes the money to the canteen owners.
The website would enable students to buy from any canteen (hall canteens/DOAA/ CC canteen/ SL canteen etc). 
It would make it easier for students to keep track of the bills and the student can view their bill at any point in time. It would also remove the need to pay at every canteen and tackle struggles like UPI servers down.

## Language/Databases used or needed-
HTML, CSS, JS
ReactJS, SQL from backend

## Things that need to be implemented-
Mail automation and bill payment method
Student search database for searching student.
